There is no history of significant expectoration, blood in sputum, wheezing, or breathing difficulty, but he has lost approx. 6.35 kg (14 lb) of weight over the last 9 months. On physical examination, his vital signs are stable, and examination of the chest reveals decreased breath sounds over the left infrascapular region. His chest radiogram suggests atelectasis in the left lower lobe. A detailed evaluation confirms a diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma involving the left main bronchus, which is 4 cm in size and is located 3.8 cm (1.5 in) from the carina. Ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, ipsilateral subcarinal lymph nodes, and ipsilateral scalene lymph nodes are involved in metastasis with no distant metastasis. Investigations also suggest that the patient does not have any comorbidity that contraindicates any anti-cancer treatment modality and that his performance status is good.
